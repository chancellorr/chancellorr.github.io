# What is *sleepless.online*?  

sleepless.online is a blog that I created to have a place to express my thoughts. A place where I could try to clear my mind on those nights where I cannot sleep. My mind races a lot at night and sleepless.online is where those thoughts live so I can try to get them out of my head so I can sleep. This is mostly just the ramblings of a sleepless man. This is a safe place. This is *sleepless.online*.  

I've recently created an irc chat for sleepless people. It's #sleepless on
