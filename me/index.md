Hello, my name is Chance. I am a photographer from Detroit Michigan who likes emo, video games, keyboards, and other nerdy things. I'm just trying to better myself day by day.

# What do you do?
I take pictures of people and things, build keyboards, and play a lot of video games. I stream on [Twitch.tv](http://twitch.tv/trashcatt)
