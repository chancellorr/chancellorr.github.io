title: Sleepless Again
---


Sleepless, again. But this time I feel like I did it to myself. Like I decided not to sleep tonight. I was already in bed, but I decided to get up and go back downstairs. It's not like I did anything productive either. I just played Pokemon. I know, I'm a grown man but instead of trying to sleep, I'm sitting awake playing a game made for children. This one is on me. I should have stayed in bed. I knew it was the right choice. I have no excuse this time. But it's funny how I'm dragging this out more by writing about it. It's been a long time since I've written anything, and that's mostly becasue I've been sleeping much better. I've really only had one or two late nights and only one sleepless night in the past couple months. It's been wonderful actually getting the sleep I need. But like all things good in my life, I go and ruin it. Hopefully this is only a one-off thing and I'll get back to sleeping normally soon. I'm really not a fan of this any more. I used to enjoy being awake at night but not anymore. Yes, it's still peaceful and calm at night. But it's also extreamly boring. Yeah, I had fun with my game, but I could also do that during the day. I don't know. This is just another pointless ramble that will forever be lost to the internet. But it helps me and I guess that's all that matters. Goodnight.
