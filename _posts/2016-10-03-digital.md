So lately I’ve been trying to focus on my digital minimalism as well as my physical minimalism. I recently deleted a bunch of music that I don’t listen to anymore off of my hard drive. I also cleaned out some folders on my computer. I have recently made the switch back to Linux Mint as I have always considered Linux to be a “more minimal OS.” So far it’s been really good, unless I want to play some Windows only games. But for the most part it’s pretty good.

I also want to try to delete useless apps off of my phone. Games I don’t play anymore. Apps I haven’t opened in months. Random bloat that I have “just in case I want to use it.” It’s all just clutter and distractions. I have drastically cut back on my social media usage with I think is really good for me. I know Shelby would like me to post more photos of her on Instagram, but I never really use it. I reinstalled Facebook just so I could get contact pictures synced to my phone but that has really been a bad idea. I don’t use it but the notifications are really annoying. I’m going to uninstall it again. I always have way more than I need on my phone and I honestly have no idea why. It’s really just a burden. But I’m really trying to change that and I think I’m heading in the right direction. I still have more to go on my computer though.



Currently listening:     *Between Waves* - **The Album Leaf**
