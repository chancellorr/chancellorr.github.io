So I'm really really bad at doing updates to my blog, but I'm going to try to do it a bit more regularly. Originally this was going to be a blog about me trying to become a minimalist. But I'm not sure that is what I want the main focus of this blog to be. I think I want it to be more of a lifestyle blog, or just my life in general. I'm not entirely sure what I mean by that though. I guess I'll just start writing things and see where it goes. Hopefully I'll be able to get something out of it and maybe someone else will too. Life is super strange and it only gets more and more difficult as we go through it. But that's why we need good people in or lives to experience it along with us. No one should have to go through this life alone and I'm finally starting to see the reasons why. I'll get more into that at a later date, but trust me when I say you are not alone. There are people who care about you, and you definitely matter. Thanks for reading this and like I said, I'll try my best to actually keep up with this. We about to get real personal up in this.
