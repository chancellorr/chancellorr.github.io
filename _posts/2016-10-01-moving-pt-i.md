title: Moving Pt. I
---

﻿So it’s been quite a while since my last post. So a quick update. I got married to my best friend. We bought a house but can’t move in until mid November. We had to move in with my grandma in the meantime. There we go. On to the post.

So I recently had to pack up everything I had in my room so that I could move. I shared a house with a good friend of mine but I kept all I owned in my room. He got married in August and I got married last month so it was time for me to move. I realized I had **so much stuff** that I just plain didn’t need. So I ended up throwing a good amount of stuff away and donating a bunch of clothes that either didn’t fit me, or I just didn’t wear anymore. It was such a good feeling to be able to get rid of that much more clutter from my life. It really is a freeing feeling to be able to get rid of things.
It also wasn’t super easy. I kept a bunch of stuff that I probably should have gotten rid of. I tend to get emotionally attached to stuff that doesn’t really matter. It’s something I’m working on slowly. I used to be the kind of person who would hold on to every card I’ve been given in my life but I’ve recently been able to break that habit. No one even expects me to keep the cards so that makes it a little bit easier for me. I still have like a box or two of things that remind me of really good people or times in my life and I haven’t been able to part with those yet but I do plan on weeding out the things I don’t really need.
I’m excited about this move because it gives me the chance to see what I actually use. I think this will be a good opportunity for both me and my wife to get rid of the clutter.
