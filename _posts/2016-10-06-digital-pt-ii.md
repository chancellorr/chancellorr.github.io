title: Digital Minimalism Pt. II
---

So today while updating my Nexus 5x with a custom Nougat ROM I accidentally deleted everything off of my phone. At first I was really upset because it deleted photos, and custom settings and backups. But then I realized what a nice, fresh start this could be. So I’m taking this as a good thing. My phone feels much snappier, I have room to store things again. This is good.

I’m still working on weeding other things out of my digital life, like social media. I do like how much I’ve cut back. I don’t check things nearly as much as I used to in the past which is nice. I still have a long way to go. I won’t cut them out completely but I want to be mindful of how much time I spend checking them. The main one for me is Reddit. I check Reddit way too much. I check it too much at work. It’s becoming a problem again.

Speaking of work. I really need to reorganize my work computer. I’ve been busy lately and it’s started to get out of hand as far as files and folders go. I’ve started just throwing things wherever and it’s causing some issues. Maybe I’ll set aside some time tomorrow to go threw and organize things. I don’t think the I.T. guy will be in tomorrow to help mp update and remove apps. Oh well. I’ll have him help me on Monday.
