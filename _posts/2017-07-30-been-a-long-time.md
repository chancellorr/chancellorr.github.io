title: It's Been A Long Time
---

So I haven't been here in a very long time. Life kind of got in the way. My first year of being married, struggling with mental illness, and normal day to day stuff. It's weird being an adult. I still don't really know what I'm doing. Basically I've just been working, spending time with my wife, and playing video games. I haven't really been pushing myself to be a better person or get better at something in my life. But recently I started to get back into learning programming and coding. It's been a lot of fun so far and I actually feel like I'm learning things. I've been using [freeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.org) to really get the basics down and I flew through the first few sections. It's starting to get a little more intense as I progress but I guess that's to be expected. I really want to stick with it this time becasue I really haven't in the past. It would be nice to be able to turn this into a career though. It's something I've always been interested in and this is probably the first time I've really been motivated enough to do it. But I am going to do it. I **NEED** a change. It's been far too long that I've felt like I've been doing nothing of value. But that all changes now. No I make something of my self.
