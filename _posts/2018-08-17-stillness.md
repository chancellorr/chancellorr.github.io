There are many reasons why I love the night time. The calmness and stillness and peacefulness. I love it. I honestly wish that same stillness could be felt during the day. Even just the relaxing sounds of the night time would be great. 

Day time is so busy and distracting. It's amazing to me that anyone can get anything done during the day. Honestly, day time is pretty awful. I personally have always felt pretty useless during the day. Like I can never focus on a task long enough to complete it or something like that. And when I can "focus" I feel like I turn out some pretty terrible work. That's been pretty constant in my life. I've always felt my best work was done at night. Granted, I've been battling insomnia since I was around 14. Nevertheless I feel my best work is done at night. That's one of the reasons that I only write for this blog at night. Well, that and the fact that I can't sleep. But whatever. Night time is great. I wish it was more socially acceptable to be awake at night and to get things done at night. I know there has to be more people out there that think like I do. I can't be alone in this thought. I mean, who doesn't want to spend more time in a  peaceful environment? Who else doesn't want to constantly feel rushed? Who else doesn't want to just be able to take a breath, and take in the calmness and stillness of night?

Why do I feel bad about being awake at night? Why am I ashamed of it? Why is that my fault? I feel like society has twisted the meanings of literally everything. There is always something in our lives that we "should feel bad about" and I think that's pretty messed up. Why aren't people allowed to be happy? So what if my happiness is different than yours? Why does that matter? Who cares? It really shouldn't matter. 

Nighttime is peaceful and God knows I need some peace.
