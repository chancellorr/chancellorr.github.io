So lately I've been trying to find ways to better myself. Ways to become a better person, ways to become a better husband, ways to become a healthier person. I want to change a lot about myself. Sadly I haven't been able to do much so far. I have serious manic depression. Not too many people know this about me but I figured I'd get it out there. It makes it really hard for me to leave the house, or interact with people face to face. Along with that I also have really bad anxiety most of the time which makes it almost impossible for me to sleep at night. I spend a lot of time in front of my computer screen not really doing anything productive. I play a lot of video games and watch a lot of YouTube videos. But it's time for something more. It's time to get out of the house. It's time to start being productive. It's time to start eating better.

My main focus right now it so become more educated in computer languages. I know the basics but that's where it ends. I need to keep my mind fresh. I need to actually take the time to work on projects. I need to do something, because sitting at home has grown really boring. My goal for the next few months is to learn at least one programming language to where I'm confident in my work. To where I feel I actually know why I'm doing what I'm doing and not just being happy that it works. I know I can do this. I have to hold myself to that too though, not just say it. Well, here's to that. Here's to a better me.
