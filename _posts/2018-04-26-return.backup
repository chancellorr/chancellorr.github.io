Insomnia sucks.

For a while I was getting better. I was going to sleep at a normal time, waking up at a somewhat normal time. Things were getting better -- until recently. Lately I've been staying awake again. Sometimes until just before my wife leaves for work. It's not healthy. People say "oh, you're just a night owl" but I know this isn't the case. I hate being awake this late, I feel awful, both physically and mentally. I just want to be a normal person again. I want to be able to go to bed and wake up at a normal time. I want to be able to hold a normal job. But holding a job is a whole separate story for a separate time.

I really don't know what else to say about insomnia that I haven't already said, so I'll just leave it at this:

Insomnia sucks. Anxiety sucks. Depression sucks. That's just the way it goes. So many of us deal with it on a daily basis and so few of us actually know how to deal with any of it. I sure as hell don't know how to deal with it but I'm doing the best I can. I'm trying to stay positive and honestly, lately, it's been working. I've been feeling better. I've been leaving the house more. I've been spending more time with my wife and my friends. But every so often I'll have a low day. A day that I don't feel like doing anything. A day where I don't want to talk to anyone. A day like I had today. And I'll fall back into this bullshit insomnia. And it'll make me think about everything. Everything that has gotten better. And I'll sit here. And write about it. And I'll second guess everything. And I'll tell myself that it will continue to get better again...
