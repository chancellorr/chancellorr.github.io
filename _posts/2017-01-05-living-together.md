title: Living Together

It's still crazy to me that I'm married, and have a house. It's still weird waking up next to someone every morning. It's weird that there is now someone who is always with me. It is in no way a bad thing. It's just still weird to me. And I know it's weird to her too. She tells me all the time. 

We have been married for almost 4 months now and it all still seems new. It's really cool to see how she's growing. She how she handles her day to day. I love learning about people believe it or not. I really do. People are fascinating, they really are. No matter how smart, or dumb, nice, or mean. People are fascinating. And I think that's what I like most about living with someone else. Learning how fascinating she is. I love the little things. I love the way she loves things. Or the way
she gets excited over little things. I love when she gets in the zone while she is editing photos or making dinner. She is fascinating.

Now I know I got a little off track with this post and it became more a post about my wife. But my point is this. People are different. People have different reasons for doing things. People have different lifestyles and they may not always agree with ours. My wife isn't a minimalist. She doesn't really want to be, and that's fine. We work things out. We find a way to make things work for both of us. If I don't think we need something and want to give it away or donate it, we talk about
it. I find out if she finds value in it and if the value is actually justified and she does the same with me. It's a good balance. It's a needed balance. It works and I'm really glad it does. 

Like I said, being a minimalist is not something she really wants. But I have a wife that fully supports my decisions and is behind me 100%.
Living with someone isn't always easy, especially when you have different views and lifestyles but you can make it work if you are both willing to work together.
