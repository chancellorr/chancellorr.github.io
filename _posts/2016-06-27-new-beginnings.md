So here we are. I've _finally_ decided to become a minimalist. I've flirted with the idea for years but have never commited. I was always too obsessed with stuff. Having the latest tech, or having _WAY_ more than what I needed of something. This blog is going to be the documentation of my journey. The good and the bad.

I've decided I need to get rid of all the useless stuff in my life. I'm getting married soon, and looking for a home. Looking for a home has been a new level of stress I never knew existed. Luckly pretty much everything I own fits in my current bedroom. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing is that I dont really have a lot to move, the bad thing is that I dont have enough to furnish a house with. So unfortunately it looks like I'll be spending a bit of money to get things going. I know that this isn't ideal, but sometimes you just have to spend some money. However, I'm going to make it a point to only buy the thing we need. So we probably wont be getting a coffee table. Or book cases. Or crazy shelving units. We will get a couch. We may have to get a smaller bed depending on the size of house we end up buying, but that's not a huge deal either.

This is a crazy learning experiance, and I'm both excited and equally terrified. But I know in the end that my journey to marrage and minimalism can fit hand in hand.
