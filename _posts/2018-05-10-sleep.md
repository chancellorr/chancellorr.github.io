So finally I've been getting some normal sleep. I'm not talking about going to bed at 9am and sleeping for a few hours. I'm talking real sleep. Going to bed around 12am and sleeping until 10am at the latest. It's honestly been such a long time since I was able to do that and it feels amazing. I already feel like a happier person. I love that I don't feel like I'm wasting my time staring a computer screen until all hours of the morning doing literally nothing. I feel like I actually have the time to do the things I want to do -- or get things done around the house. I feel like I'm able to retain the things I'm learning in my online courses. It feels great.

Now, I'm not trying to brag, or act like my life is automatically perfect. I'm still struggling. I still have the same thoughts I had before. It's just that now I feel rested enough to not let them completely drag me down. It's kind of funny how this blog is called *sleepless.online* and I'm writing a post about how I can actually sleep. But that's what this blog was for. It was a place for my sleepless rants. A place for me to jot down my thoughts where I'd be able to go back and look at them when I was feeling some sort of way. Where I could reflect on my past, and better my future. I feel like things are really starting to improve.
	
A lot of it, I feel, has to do with the weather. It's been a lot warmer around here lately. I've been able to sleep with the windows open. I'm a big fan of being able to sleep with the windows open and smell the air, feel the breeze, and just listen to the sounds out side. It gives me a weird *peace*. It's honestly been great and I feel like it is the main reason that I've been able to sleep. Hopefully I can keep this going. But I know I'll still be needing this blog.
